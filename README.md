# Usage

1. Click on the app for your device.
      (windows = app-win)
      (mac = app-macos)
      (linux = app-linux)
2. Paste the links (REMEMBER - RIGHT CLICK TO PASTE, CTRL+V WON'T WORK AND CTRL+C WILL CLOSE THE PROGRAM)
        - NOTE: Don't worry if the link looks weird, it's most likely fine.
